1. Use Filter and wrapper to do "feature selection", 
  Once get results, do normalization, then append "flow ID, srcIP, dstIP, timestamp" to the feature subset.
  The subset should be like this....
  'flow ID, timestamp, srcIP, dstIP, feature subset' 
  
  This subset should be gave to others to use.
  
  
 2.Plot the figure about that the accuracy declines along with the number of features in feature subset decreased.
  The figure likes:
    x axis is the number of features in feature subset.
    y axis is the accuracy on different feature subset.
    
 3. Use PCA or AE to do "feature selection"
 
 
 4. implement SVM, RF, DT, LR as our typical classifiers
